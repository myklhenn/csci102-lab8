				<p>The color scheme was chosen for this page because the white text stands out nicely against the black and grey background 
				for optimal readability. The orange color for some titles and web links also stands out well, and provides an accent 
				color to compliment the white text. The fonts were chosen to match/go well with each other, as most of them were 
				selected from the font set that is used in the open source linux distribution Ubuntu.</p>
				<p>The target audience for this site is web users who are interested in music--especially the styles of jazz, funk, 
				new age, etc. that are infused into my musical style--regardless of age, but geared mostly toward teens and older. As such,
				the colors and fonts on this page were chosen to appeal to this target audience of a rather wide-spread age group.</p>
				<p>This web site uses a shallow hierarchical organization, and the small number of pages to link to enables this to be an 
				effective method of organization. It does not use linear organization because the pages are not viewed in sequential order, 
				and it does not use random organization because the pages are not viewed and linked to randomly.</p>
				<p>This web site uses the "jello" design technique, as the page content is relatively centered in the window and adjusts to 
				stay in the center based on the window's size. It does not use the "ice" design technique because it is not as rigid and 
				fixed to the left side of the window, as would be the case if this technique were used, and it does not use the "liquid" 
				design technique because the page content does not completely fill the browser regardless of the window's size.</p>
